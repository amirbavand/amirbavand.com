I am a Software Research Engineer based in Toronto. Currently I work at <a href="https://www.wesleyclover.com">Guidewire Software</a> as a Software Egninieer, focusing on backend infrastructure. My team and I are primarily dedicated to enhancing the reliability and maintainability of Guidewire's backend cloud and infrastructure.

Previously I was a Full-Stack Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.wesleyclover.com">Wesley Clover</a>. I mainly worked on Edge-Signal, which is an edge-computing management platform. I worked on different parts of the platform including, the backend, infrastructure, device, and frontend of our web application.

Before joining Wesley Clover, I was a software Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en">Ericsson</a>. At Ericcson, I studied the impact of combining parallel and batch testing and came up with a solution to decrease the feedback time of testing by 14% for a particular part of their continuous integration pipeline.

I finished my Master of Computer Science degree at Concordia University where I was fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~pcr/">Peter Rigby</a>. My thesis was mainly about using different time-series and algorithmic techniques to decrease the cost of software testing.

I also have done my bachelor's in computer engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want to talk about a cool project.
